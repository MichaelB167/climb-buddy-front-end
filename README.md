# Project Components

Live application: <http://michaelb167.github.io/climb-buddy-front-end/>

Back end repository: <https://github.com/MichaelB167/climb-buddy-back-end>

## App Explanation

## Technologies Used

I used HTML and SCSS to style the page's front end.  To add the menu modals I
applied bootsrap styling.  JQuery facilitates user interaction with the
gameboard via click handlers and produces a display of the game's result upon a
win or tie condition being met.  To communicate with the back end I used a
combination of jQuery, Javascript and AJAX.

## Approach Taken

In an effort to maintain modularity in my code I limited index files to
containing requirements rather than code as well as created separate directories
for files such as AJAX requests and event handlers.  To backup and track my
project, I made frequent and descriptive commits to my project repository.
